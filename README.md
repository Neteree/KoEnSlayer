# KoEN Slayer

## Important Information
If you are on Windows, please make sure that you add the Korean Input Method Editor(IME), so that you are able to type in Korean. You can find more information about the IME at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/input/korean-ime. Once set up you can press right alt to alternate between English and Korean.

If you want to get Korean input working on other platforms you will have to look that up, as I have not currently tried on any other platforms, besides Windows.
